Generating a zk-SNARK circuit for a neural network using libsnark is a complex task. Due to the high-level nature of PyTorch and the low-level nature of libsnark, you'll need to bridge the gap between the two libraries. This process will require you to:

1. Convert the PyTorch model to a more suitable format.
2. Implement the model as a zk-SNARK circuit using libsnark.

Unfortunately, providing a full example is beyond the scope of this response. However, I can provide you with a high-level overview of the steps you would need to take.

### 1. Convert the PyTorch model to a more suitable format

You'll need to export the PyTorch model to a format that can be more easily used with libsnark. One option is to use ONNX to export the model, and then implement a custom ONNX parser to convert the model into a format compatible with libsnark.

Here's an example of how you would export the PyTorch model to ONNX:

```python
import torch.onnx

dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)
onnx_filename = "simple_cnn.onnx"

torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, onnx_filename, input_names=["input"], output_names=["output"])
```

### 2. Implement the model as a zk-SNARK circuit using libsnark

Once you've exported the model to a suitable format, you'll need to implement the model as a zk-SNARK circuit using libsnark. This will involve creating a libsnark circuit that mimics the neural network's forward pass.

You'll need to implement the following operations in libsnark:

1. Convolutional layers.
2. ReLU activation functions.
3. Max-pooling layers.
4. Fully connected layers.

You can refer to the [libsnark tutorial](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark-tutorial) for an introduction to creating circuits with the library. Keep in mind that implementing a neural network as a zk-SNARK circuit is highly challenging and will require significant optimization to fit within the constraints of the proof system.

### Alternative approach: Use a dedicated zk-SNARK library for neural networks

As an alternative, you might consider using a dedicated library for creating zk-SNARKs of neural networks, such as [ZEN](https://github.com/AdamISZ/zensnark). ZEN provides a higher-level interface for creating zk-SNARK circuits for neural networks and could be a more suitable choice for this task. However, this library is still experimental and may require significant work to adapt to your specific use case.


To create dense, softmax, and ReLU layers in C++ and Ethereum-compatible JavaScript, you need to implement the respective functions in each language. Please note that, in Ethereum-compatible JavaScript, you'll need to use fixed-point arithmetic for math operations due to the lack of proper support for floating-point numbers in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. 

Here's a simple implementation of the requested layers in C++:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <numeric>

class DenseLayer {
public:
  DenseLayer(const std::vector<std::vector<double>> &weights, const std::vector<double> &biases)
      : weights(weights), biases(biases) {}

  std::vector<double> forward(const std::vector<double> &input) {
    std::vector<double> output(weights[0].size(), 0.0);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < weights.size(); ++i) {
      for (size_t j = 0; j < weights[i].size(); ++j) {
        output[j] += input[i] * weights[i][j];
      }
    }

    for (size_t j = 0; j < output.size(); ++j) {
      output[j] += biases[j];
    }
    return output;
  }

private:
  std::vector<std::vector<double>> weights;
  std::vector<double> biases;
};

std::vector<double> softmax(const std::vector<double> &input) {
  std::vector<double> output(input.size());
  double max_input = *std::max_element(input.begin(), input.end());
  double sum_exp = 0.0;

  for (size_t i = 0; i < input.size(); ++i) {
    output[i] = std::exp(input[i] - max_input);
    sum_exp += output[i];
  }

  for (size_t i = 0; i < output.size(); ++i) {
    output[i] /= sum_exp;
  }

  return output;
}

std::vector<double> relu(const std::vector<double> &input) {
  std::vector<double> output(input.size());
  for (size_t i = 0; i < input.size(); ++i) {
    output[i] = std::max(0.0, input[i]);
  }
  return output;
}


And here's an implementation of the requested layers in Ethereum-compatible JavaScript using fixed-point arithmetic:

const FIXED_POINT_FACTOR = 1e6;

function multiplyFixedPoint(a, b) {
  return Math.round((a * b) / FIXED_POINT_FACTOR);
}

function denseLayer(weights, biases, input) {
  let output = new Array(biases.length).fill(0);
  for (let i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < weights[i].length; j++) {
      output[j] += multiplyFixedPoint(input[i], weights[i][j]);
    }
  }

  for (let j = 0; j < output.length; j++) {
    output[j] += biases[j];
  }
  return output;
}

function softmax(input) {
  let output = new Array(input.length);
  let maxInput = Math.max(...input);
  let sumExp = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    output[i] = Math.round(Math.exp((input[i] - maxInput) / FIXED_POINT_FACTOR));
    sumExp += output[i];
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < output.length; i++) {
    output[i] = Math.round((output[i] * FIXED_POINT_FACTOR) / sumExp);
  }
  return output;
}

function relu(input) {
  let output = new Array(input.length);
  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    output[i] = Math.max(0, input[i]);
  }
  return output;
}


Keep in mind that these implementations are simple and not optimized for performance. In practice, you might want to use a library such as Eigen for C++ or TensorFlow.js for JavaScript, which provide optimized and efficient implementations of these layers.
